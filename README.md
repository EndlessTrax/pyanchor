Dead links are an annoyance for websites with an extensive amount of content. A side from the
negative impact on SEO, dead links are an annoyance for any user that clicks on one.

PyAnchor is primarily for checking the HTTP response on all links on a page. You can integrate it
into your development workflow so that users never see a 404 in the first place.

## Install

PyAnchor requires Python 3.7 and above.

MacOS / Linux:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install pyanchor
```

Windows:

```cmd
> python -m pip install pyanchor
```

## Using the CLI

The CLI can be invoked with the `pyanchor` command. A URL **must** be provided unless it's the help page.

To get the help page:

```shell script
> pyanchor --help
```

Basic example for a single page:
> Note: all provided URLs must include a valid HTTP scheme.

```shell
> pyanchor https://mysite.com/
```

If you want to check all links on a website, and not just a single page, a `sitemap.xml` URL may be
provided and flagged with `--sitemap`.

Example:

```shell script
> pyanchor https://mysite.com/sitemap.xml --sitemap
```

By default, successful requests are not printed to the terminal. To see all urls with a `200`
response add the `--verbose` flag.

```shell script
> pyanchor https://mysite.com --verbose
```

```shell script
> pyanchor https://mysite.com/sitemap.xml --sitemap --verbose
```

## But wait, there's more...

To integrate PyAnchor into your application, you can import the `LinkResults` class. `LinkResults`
requires a URL.

Example:

```
>>> from pyanchor.link_checker import LinkResults
>>> r = LinkResults("https://mysite.com/")
>>> r.results
{200: ["https://mysite.com/about/", "https://mysite.com/contact/"], 500: ["https://mysite.com/doh!/"]}
```

As you can see the `results` attribute is a dictionary containing all response codes returned as a
dictionary key, with a list of URLs that achieve that response code as the dictionary value.

### Analyzing Links

PyAnchor give you the ability to use the `LinkAnalysis` class to check the links in a given URL for unsafe and obsolete attributes.

To check for obsolete attributes use the `obsolete_attrs` property:

```
>>> from pyanchor.link_checker import LinkAnalysis
>>> r = LinkAnalysis("https://mysite.com/")
>>> r.obsolete_attrs
{'/about/link-1': ['charset', 'rev'], '/about/link-2': ['name']}
```

Likewise you can check for unsafe linkes with `unsafe_attrs`:

```
>>> from pyanchor.link_checker import LinkAnalysis
>>> r = LinkAnalysis("https://mysite.com/")
>>> r.unsafe_attrs
{<a href="/about/link-4" target="_blank">Link 4</a>: True, <a href="/about/link-5" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Link 5</a>: False}
```

Any link that **does not** include `rel="noopener"` when the `target` attribute is used will return `True`. As in, **it is True that this link is unsafe**. Therfore, links with appropriate attributes will return `False`.

## How to Contribute

Please **raise an issue** before making a PR, so that the issue and implementation can be discussed before you write any code. **This will save you time**, and increase the chances of your PR being merged without significant changes. 

Please make PR's on a **new branch**, and _not_ on main/master. 

Please **format you code** with [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).

Please **include tests** for any PR's that include code (unless current tests cover your code contribution).
